gradually over many incarnations
picking up momentum
like a spiral
culminating in a particular life
at the mercy of your mother's actions
protected only by your sack
unconscious existence
sack ruptured
unconscious existence ends
living being
pain and effort
passing
at the mercy of the elemental forces of the world
