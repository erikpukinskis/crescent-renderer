How to model:

just place voxels in super coarse space. 10x10x10 chicken or whatever

then zoom in and be able to connect same-colored voxels to each other in a line. give voxels a thickness at each point in the line, then draw a slug shape over all of them

Widen a given line in any direction to make it even fatter in places, and possibly bent
